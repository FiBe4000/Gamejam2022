## 1. Code style
Set your godot editor to 2 spaces for indentation.

### 1.1 Godot signals
When connecting signals, if it is possible to do it
statically in the GUI, do it statically. If it is not
possible, do it dynamically in the code.

## Git
Set git to use LF line endings, 
`git config --global core.autocrlf input`
